# AI Code Auditor

**Multi-agent AI code quality analysis powered by Claude**

Get comprehensive, actionable feedback across 7 specialized dimensions: correctness, security, performance, maintainability, edge cases, accessibility, and documentation.

```bash
# Audit your codebase
code-audit src/

# Get instant quality insights
✓ Correctness     8.5/10
✓ Security        9.2/10
⚠ Performance     6.8/10
✓ Maintainability 8.1/10
⚠ Edge Cases      6.5/10

Overall Score: 7.8/10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐
```

## Why AI Code Auditor?

**🎯 Specialized Analysis** - Seven AI agents, each an expert in a specific quality dimension, analyze your code in parallel for deeper insights than generic code review tools.

**⚡ Fast & Comprehensive** - Get detailed analysis in seconds. Identifies issues human reviewers often miss: race conditions, edge cases, security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks.

**📊 Actionable Reports** - Color-coded terminal output, markdown exports, and optional dashboard integration. Track quality trends over time and share results with your team.

**🔧 Works Anywhere** - CLI tool, web dashboard, or GitHub Action. Supports TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, and C/C++.

## Quick Start

### CLI Tool

```bash
# Install (macOS)
brew install ai-code-auditor

# Or download binary from releases
curl -L https://github.com/yourorg/ai-code-auditor/releases/latest/download/code-audit-darwin-arm64 -o code-audit
chmod +x code-audit

# Set your Anthropic API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-key-here'

# Audit a file or directory
code-audit src/

# Save report
code-audit src/ --output report.md
```

### GitHub Action

Add to `.github/workflows/code-audit.yml`:

```yaml
name: Code Quality
on: [pull_request]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: yourorg/ai-code-auditor@v1
        with:
          anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

Every PR automatically gets quality feedback as a comment.

### Web Dashboard

Track quality over time and collaborate with your team:

1. **Sign up** at https://code-auditor.com
2. **Create team** and invite members
3. **Get API key** from dashboard
4. **Login from CLI**: `code-audit login`
5. **Run audits**: Results automatically sync to dashboard

[See dashboard setup guide →](apps/web/README.md)

## How It Works

AI Code Auditor uses **7 specialized AI agents** that analyze your code in parallel:

### 1. Correctness Agent (22%)
Finds logic errors, type safety issues, incorrect API usage, and null handling problems.

### 2. Security Agent (22%)
Identifies SQL injection, XSS, authentication issues, data exposure, and crypto weaknesses.

### 3. Performance Agent (13%)
Detects algorithmic complexity issues, memory leaks, inefficient database queries, and missing caching opportunities.

### 4. Maintainability Agent (15%)
Analyzes code complexity, error handling, code duplication, and naming conventions.

### 5. Edge Cases Agent (13%)
Uncovers boundary conditions, race conditions, resource exhaustion, and rare failure scenarios.

### 6. Accessibility Agent (10%)
Checks WCAG compliance, semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.

### 7. Documentation Agent (5%)
Ensures public APIs are documented with JSDoc/TSDoc, complex logic is explained, and examples are provided.

Each agent returns a score (0-10) with detailed findings. The **overall score** is a weighted average based on the importance of each dimension.

```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
code-audit --changed-files
```

**PR reviews** - Automated quality feedback on pull requests via GitHub Action

**Onboarding** - Help new team members understand code quality standards:
```bash
code-audit legacy/ --output onboarding-guide.md
```

**Refactoring** - Measure quality improvements:
```bash
code-audit src/ --output before.md
# ... refactor ...
code-audit src/ --output after.md
diff before.md after.md
```

**CI/CD pipeline** - Fail builds on critical issues:
```bash
code-audit src/ || exit 1
```
